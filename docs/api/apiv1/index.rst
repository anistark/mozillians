Getting an API Key
------------------

Community and Mozilla Corporation sites can request an API key by `submitting a bug <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Participation%20Infrastructure&component=API%20Requests>`_. The bug should include the **URL and description of the application** and **details about the expected use of API data**.

All requests are reviewed by product owners and data safety experts; not all requests are approved. 

API keys are granted per application, not per user.
